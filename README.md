> This is an HTML template that is used to advertise or announce specific services on offer. It was developed for Mediaphonix. The focus is placed on either a single room, or in the case of this template, the experiences in and around the lodge. This template runs for the duration of the campaign, but could also be used by certain digital screens within the building, for use by guests. The design can be adapted to the brand of the client as needed. This particular template uses demo content grabbed from: https://www.glamping-resorts.de/
